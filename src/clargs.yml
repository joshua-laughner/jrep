      long_help: >
        Which types of cell output to search. Internally, a Jupyter notebook cell may have multiple types of output,
        such as text and an image. These are identified by keys such as 'text/plain' and 'image/png'. By default, 'text/plain' 
        output types are included in a search. Passing *any* output type option overrides this, so `-O image/png` means that
        only 'image/png' output types are searched. This option may be specified multiple times to include multiple types.
        

        Note that there is no checking of the output types given, so if you mistype (e.g. 'img/png' instead of 'image/png') jrep
        cannot check that you have entered an type that will never be present.
        

        Also note that this only affects searching cell output; whether cell source code is searched depends on the --include-source
        and --no-include-source flags.
        

        This, --include-output, and --no-include output all override each other. Whichever option is given last will determine the
        behavior.
