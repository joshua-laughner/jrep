## Which documentation
Which documentation is the problem in - the command line interface, docs.rs, or both?

## What would you like improved
If part of the documentation is unclear, quote the part in question and specify what is unclear to you. Explain how you interpret the documentation. If something is missing from the documentation, state what that is and where you would expect to see it.
